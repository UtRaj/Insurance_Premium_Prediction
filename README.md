# Insurance_Premium_Prediction

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict insurance premiums based on relevant features using machine learning. By leveraging a dataset containing information about insured individuals, we aim to build a predictive model that estimates insurance premiums accurately. This can aid insurance companies in pricing their policies more effectively.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model employed for premium prediction is the Gradient Boosting Regressor. The model achieved a commendable R-squared score of 0.86, indicating its effectiveness in capturing the variance in insurance premiums. Additionally, the mean squared error and cross-validation scores provide insights into the model's predictive performance.
